<h2>Elemental Chaos</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You are a shaman searching through a system of caves for corrupted elementals causing horrific storms throughout the world!  You have the power to temporarily merge with elemental spirits, in order to purify them, and bring peace back to the world!
</li>
<p>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Hopefully, the players will experience an increasingly challenging time, yet still have fun!
</li>
</p><p>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Adventure Puzzle
(i.e., an exploration game mixed with Rock-Paper-Scissors and maze puzzles).
</li>
</p><p>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You may walk through the mazelike caves, chasing any rogue spirit until you touch it in order to absorb its element.  The first element you catch is automatically absorbed, but after that, you may get hurt if touching an element that isn't absorbed by the one you have.  For example, should you have a water spirit, you would be able to absorb a water spirit while earth spirits would be able to absorb you!  Absorb all of them to win, but finding them in a safe order might be tough.  Since nature is in chaos, there might even be rifts that open to other places...

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>

</li>
</p><p>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are a young shaman living in a normally calm valley, between the sea and several snowcapped mountains. Then one day, people start to feel the ground shake beneath them, the winds begin to howl, the mountains start spewing molten rock, and the waves thrash the beach, threatening to flood your homeland.  Having grown up learning from the village wise one, you knew the day when many elements would become erratic would arrive.  Few people survive such chaotic times without the help of shaman willing to brave the spirit dwellings; you start here.
